# Hank TVC Mount
This is a design for a TVC mount, given the title.<br>
The mount was designed with hot glue in mind (no rocket can go without hot glue) and uses <br>
M4 screws for the actual mechanical systems, and M5 for airframe mounting. Also, please, for the love of whoever <br>
**DO NOT USE THIS FOR MISSILES OR DEFENSE SYSTEMS**<br>
Anyway, THANKS!
